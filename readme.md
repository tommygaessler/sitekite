[Here is the Deployed Website](http://sitekite.co/)

## What is SiteKite?
SiteKite is an application developed and designed by 5 Galvanize students for the Unit 2 Project. This website is designed to make creating a personal portfolio website fast, easy, and fun. It will also make it easy for a company to view your portfolio, and if they like what they see, they can contact you directly from your personal portfolio!
### How does it work?
When you log into our website using your github account, SiteKite auto populates an entire portfolio for you. You can then change the theme/layout of your portfolio, add more detailed descriptions, add/edit your projects, and change any information that was pulled from github. This allows you to make the portfolio you create with SiteKite more personalized.

#### Please follow the steps below to get SiteKite set up for local development.

1. git clone or fork this repo
1. Create a .env
  - _hint:_ re-name the `.sample_env` file to `.env` and insert the appropriate data in the "quotes"
1. go into *src/server/config/main-config.js* and uncomment line 22
1. `npm install` the packages

#### To start the server locally
